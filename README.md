# üõ°Ô∏è Online Payments Fraud Detection

This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions using machine learning techniques. It leverages a real-world dataset of online payment transactions to build a binary classification model that distinguishes between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.

## üìä Dataset

**Source**: [Kaggle - Online Payments Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ananthu19/online-payments-fraud-detection/input)

**Description**:  
The dataset contains a total of **6362620** records and **10** features including transaction amount, type, and origin/destination accounts.

- `step` - Time step unit (hour)
- `type` - Type of transaction (e.g., CASH_OUT, TRANSFER)
- `amount` - Amount of the transaction
- `nameOrig` - Customer who initiated the transaction
- `oldbalanceOrg` - Initial balance before transaction
- `newbalanceOrig` - New balance after transaction
- `nameDest` - Recipient of the transaction
- `oldbalanceDest` - Initial recipient balance
- `newbalanceDest` - New recipient balance
- `isFraud` - Target variable (1 = fraud, 0 = legitimate)
